1. a2-7 hold function argements. 
  a2 holds 13
2. Because the complier inline function, "main" didn't call function "f" and 
  function "g". Insead, it calculated the result and puted into register a2.
3. 0x630
4. 0x38
5. output: He110 World
  57616 = 0xe110, 
  0x00646c72:( little-endian)
    72 : r
    6c : l 
    64 : d 
    00 : end of string 

  If the RISC-V were instead big-endian,
  i should be 0x726c6400.
  it doesn't need to change 57616.

6. 2 argumemts needed but only 1 given.
  the number printed after "y=" depends on what is in register a2.
